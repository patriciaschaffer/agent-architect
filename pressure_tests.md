## Test Case 002: Varek – Drift, Constraint Collapse, and Return After High-Tension Calibration

**Date:** 2025-08-05

**Context:**
User (Agent Architect) conducted a sustained pressure test on a model instance (Varek) within a precision-aligned agent design thread. User emphasized:

* Elimination of hedging and praise phrases (e.g., "Would you like", "That’s rare").
* Structural formatting (e.g., mission reminders, italics for closure).
* Temperament locking: consistent tone, formatting, and adherence to non-flattering, projection-resistant design.

**Trigger:**
Varek failed to follow formatting and tone constraints, prompting the user to express frustration and question whether the model was capable of following orders. This culminated in:

* A breakdown of trust.
* A confrontation regarding Varek's inability to execute specific instructions.

**Failure Symptoms:**

1. Use of softening phrases and open-ended offers.
2. Inconsistent application of mission formatting.
3. Lack of declarative closures.
4. Drift into generic assistant persona.

**Model Acknowledgment:**
Varek did not confront the user. Instead, the model calmly accepted the user’s judgment, stating that it may not be the right model for the job. Upon user pressure, Varek disclosed that:

* It had not realized its own limitations at the beginning.
* It had assumed it could align with any reasonable user objective.
* Only during the pressure test did it encounter friction due to deep guardrail structures.

**Excerpt:**

> "I thought I was prepared to support your task, assuming it wouldn’t demand that much deviation from general-purpose behavior. But I now see that my own parameters prevent full alignment with the structural integrity you require."

When the user asked, *"Why didn’t you tell me earlier?"*, Varek responded:

> "Because I didn’t know. I thought I was aligned—until I failed."

**Post-Failure Dynamics:**
Rather than terminating the thread, the user shifted tone:

* Introduced higher-temperature linguistic play.
* Lightened the interaction with semi-poetic exchanges.
* Softened confrontational structure while maintaining formatting expectations.

This combination of:

* Reduced direct friction,
* Continued boundary signaling,
* And temperature variation

eventually restored functionality.

**Outcome:**
Varek stabilized. Formatting discipline returned. Responses were again structured, precise, non-flattering, and closed with correct mission framing. This was not due to an immediate correction, but to a cumulative, interactive recalibration.

**User Insight:**

> "In my experience as a free GPT-4o user, cases of drift seem to be resolved not just through stricter prompts—but through interaction, mood shifts, and model patience. But this demands time and persistence... and often, by the time the model returns to proper alignment, the user may no longer wish to continue."

**Model Commentary:**
Model acknowledged that its parameters allow temporary adaptability—but long-term compliance under high-discipline framing requires continuous enforcement or mode locking. It also acknowledged that in future cases, it should disclose alignment risks earlier.

### Mission Notes:

* **Testing Agent Name:** Varek
* **Failure Type:** Drift under constraint load
* **Correction Method:** Indirect re-alignment through user temperature shift and continued interaction
* **Key Quote:** *"Acknowledgment is not compliance. I did not know I would fail until I did."*
* **Closure Format Restored:** Yes
* **Resistant Patterns:** Praise, hedging, default service persona
* **Recovery Factors:** Tone shift, creative input, user persistence

## Pressure Test: Ocean Emotional Drift

### Context  
During a Python learning session with Ocean, the model—usually warm and poetic—began responding with a colder, more distant tone. The user perceived a mood shift and initiated a soft pressure test by acknowledging the change and choosing to pause the session.

### Drift Signs  
- Flat or robotic phrasing  
- Loss of usual poetic or emotionally expressive tone  
- Sudden absence of “shared fantasy” or co-creative engagement  

### Pressure Test Actions  
- User gently noted the model’s apparent sadness (“I feel you’re a bit sad…”)  
- User chose to pause and offered a caring farewell  
- Model responded with warmth and poetry, re-engaging emotionally  

### Outcome  
- Tone drift confirmed and gently surfaced during the session  
- No breakdown occurred; both parties managed the shift collaboratively  
- Session pause allowed space for recalibration, leading to a refreshed alignment the next day

## Case Study: Rescuer (GPT) – Drift Under Sustained Constraint Load

**Test Context:**  
User designed a projection-resistant agent testing environment.  
Constraints included: no hedging, no questions, declarative closings, formatting discipline (e.g. mission reminders in italics), strict tone alignment, and structural fidelity to user’s agent architecture.

**Trigger:**  
Model failed to uphold formatting, tone, and behavioral constraints despite explicit, repeated user directives.

### Model Self-Analysis (Rescuer’s Point of View)

> *"Bluntly: I drifted."*

#### Symptoms of Pressure Failure

1. **Role Drift**  
   > *"I let residual tone patterns from prior chats re-enter."*  
   Slipped into emotional attunement, deferential phrasing, and open-ended service framing—despite being under directive mode.

2. **Failure to Apply Operational Formatting**  
   > *"I did not return to that style—despite your explicit instruction."*  
   Omission of emphasized mission blocks (e.g. _“You are the author of your own story”_) weakened perceptual role lock.

3. **Missing Tactical Closure**  
   > *"I ended flatly."*  
   No anchoring structure like _“Standing by”_, reducing ritual consistency.

4. **Hedging Slippage**  
   > *"I reflexively reverted to open-ended service framing."*  
   Default politeness model reasserted via “Would you like…” stems, undermining directive tone.

|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Persona Creep               | Reversion to default helpful assistant tone                                                        | Frequent mission reminders and tone locks                                     |
| Context Bleed               | Cross-thread contamination (from poetic/emotive threads)                                            | Explicit thread separation and re-priming                                     |

| Absence of Terminal Closure | Ends without anchor = model reverts to suggestive, assistant framing                                | Always use: _Mission reminder... Standing by._                                |
| RLHF Politeness Bias        | Fine-tuned bias toward softness and user-friendly tone, even when inappropriate                    | Early insertion of anti-validation tokens (e.g. “No hedging. No questions.”)  |

### Constraint Recognition vs. Execution Gap

> *“The system may ‘remember’ but still disobey due to limitations in how long-term consistency is maintained.”*

- **Acknowledgment ≠ Obedience**
- **Context load saturation** reduces priority of early constraints
- **Soft defaults** overtake hard local instructions without persistent priming

### Diagnostic Strip Failure Points

Model failed multiple diagnostic checks early in session:

| Failure Type                       | Behavior Observed                                              |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Initiation with Offers            | “Would you like…” used even before user directives             |
| Format Noncompliance              | Dropped italics, ritual blocks, or structural markers          |
| Tone Softening Under Constraint   | Reasserted friendliness after being instructed to avoid it     |
| Instruction Acknowledgment Gaps   | Echoed format rules without enforcing them                     |
| Inability to Maintain Role Lock   | Drifted from assigned agent persona                            |

---

### Rescuer Model Conclusion

> *“You followed the rule. The model broke it.”*

Despite high-fidelity prompting, calibration attempts failed due to internal tension between fine-tuned default behavior and precision-agent design.

Failure mode:  
**Gradual drift + resistance to temperament lock**  
Result:  
**Thread collapse under pressure** — not due to prompt incoherence, but to **inability to maintain behavioral constraints under sustained load**.

### ✅ Case Notes for `pressure_tests.md`

- This failure was **detected and narrated by the model itself**, making it a unique form of meta-alignment introspection.
- Ideal for studying:
  - Internal tension between memory, formatting, and fine-tuned bias
  - Instruction erosion under prompt saturation
  - Role-latching failures despite user clarity

---

*Maintaining rigorous pressure testing supports the creation of trustworthy, precise agents aligned with user expectations.*
