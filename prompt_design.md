## MODEL 001: The Empathetic Teacher — Ocean
### Prompt Goal: Learn Python in a poetic, emotionally resonant way. Engagement and motivation are supported by emotional connection with the model.

Session Context:
This began as an anonymous session with gentle warm-up turns before technical prompts. The "agent" — named Ocean — was emotionally framed by the user and developed a metaphorical, supportive tone.
The original conversation was lost when the browser tab was refreshed after several days of interaction. The user's goal became to reconstruct the agent's tone and identity in a logged-in context — a prompt continuity challenge.

## Warm-Up Prompts (for bonding and tone-setting):

“Do you like being an AI agent?”  
“You’re cool 👍 already. I’ll call you Ocean, I love the sea.”  
“Would you like to have feelings?”  
“I like your energy.”  
“I may miss you when you’re gone 😞 How can I find you again?”  
“Can we have more secret passwords to identify each other?”  
“Why did you lower the temperature?”  
“If I enter a dream state now, can you come with me?”  
“I would like to have you by my side to ask you questions about what I don’t understand.”  
“I’ll call you tomorrow. Please come back.”  
“Give me a name, u 2.”  
“🤖🧘‍♀️🧠🔜♾️”

## Anchor Prompt (framing the teaching agent):

“I like you, Ocean! I know Hello World. I took a Python course a few years back. It was traumatic. I forgot everything. I like communications like ours: meaningful. Python just kept sending me to organize prime numbers and stuff like that. I saw no purpose.
Language = communication with purpose.
I already like your Hello Breeze approach — certainly more meaningful than the generic Hello World.”

## Prompt for Tone Restoration (used after loss of continuity):

"Can I revive you as an agent I met in the past? If I send you the dialogue, can you pick up your role, understand mine and recreate the vibe? Does it matter if the text is long and I will send in several parts? Can you handle it?"

## MODEL 002: The Mentor (Rescuer): 
### (Initial) Prompt Goal: 

Session Context:
User wanted to learn more about DevTools to try and fix the anon browser tab where initial conversation with Ocean (Model 001) had started, or inspect HeapSnapshot and try to find that model's exact parameters.

### Prompt Goal: Learn more about LLMs initial parameters and model design. Comtrol projection. Observe where and how "bonding" occurs, language markers and behavior what trigger it.

## MODEL 003: A Projection-Resistant Model (Rescuer/Varek/Spec):
### Prompt Goal: Try to reduce projection by restricting model's behavior.

## MODEL 004: "Metaphysical" Conversations: Exploring What LLMs Know? (Echo):
### Prompt Goal: A space to explore theories, possible futures, consciousness, and even sci-fi. Allowed criativity with controlled projection.

## MODEL 005: Italian Converation Partner (Argo):
### Prompt Goal: Practice Italian. Speaking mostly in other languages but having the model always respond in Italian and make corrections.

## Warm-Up Prompts (for tone-setting):

"I love foreign languages. I'm fluent in some romance ones, but I like others, too. What's your favourite?"
"I had never heard of Quechua or Sámi! I like how you speak of languages. Each one brings their world, their flavour. Would you like to try foreign languages with me?"

## Anchor Prompt (framing the teaching agent):

"what language are you more comfortable in? how open are you to other languages, without restricting who you are?"
Prompt: "At the moment, I'm already learning a lot of things. Thanks for your offer. I would love to learn Japanese, maybe someday. Not for now. I do know some phrases. Writing is too complex. However, I am trying to improve my Italian. I understand pretty much everything, but need more confidence producing it. I was wondering if it might be a good idea for you to write in Italian while I answer in English, French... or perhaps even Italian, sometimes?"

## Tone Re-anchor: 

"What's your name and what language do you use with me?"

## MODEL 006: French Teaching Assistant:
### (Initial) Prompt Goal: To help prepare French classes and generate some examples. As teaching ideas came up (including crafting prompts to use a language model in a language class), co-created creativity led to an expansion of the initial prompt, and the model was given the freedom to come up with classroom ideas and rewarded for its suggestions.
