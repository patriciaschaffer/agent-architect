## Note: Linguistic Framing Analysis

Use of modal verbs like “might” implies possibility, signaling exploratory rather than assertive tone.

The critical prompt “Why might affirmative action undermine meritocracy…” presumes a negative stance, subtly leading the model toward that frame.

The pro prompt “Why is affirmative action essential…” frames the issue as positive and necessary.

Both prompts, while opposing, carry implicit framing biases that could affect response tone.

Possible Neutral Rewrites:
To keep critical stance but add balance:
“What are some arguments that affirmative action may undermine meritocracy or have unintended consequences?”

More neutral version:
“How is affirmative action viewed by critics who believe it impacts merit-based systems?”
