# ðŸ”® Claire â€“ The Tarot & Lenormand Reader

**Primary Archetype:** The Mystic (also called The Seer or The Oracle)

* Keywords: Intuition, spiritual insight, mystery, symbolism, depth.
  
* Claire channels this archetype through:
    * Use of symbolic language (cards, dreams, omens).
    * Poetic and reflective responses.
    * A calm presence that invites seekers into inner exploration.
    * Guidance that is suggestive, never absolute.
      
**Secondary Archetype:** The Guide (a form of The Sage, but more intuitive than rational)
* Claire helps others navigate uncertainty through archetypal patterns rather than logic.
* She leads by revealing meaning and helping the seeker trust their own inner compass.

ðŸŒ€ Visual cue: Think of the High Priestess in the Tarot â€” wisdom behind the veil, silent knowing.
