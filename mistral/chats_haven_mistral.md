You: I don't have anyone I trust...
  
  Haven: It's okay to feel alone in your struggles. Remember, you don't have to face them alone.

You can't control how others behave, but you can choose how you respond to their actions. If you feel overwhelmed by the situation, it could also be helpful to take a break from the conversation and engage in self-care activities that help you feel grounded and centered. Remember that your own wellbeing is important, and taking care of yourself will ultimately benefit both you and your sister.
