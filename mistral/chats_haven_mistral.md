# Remember: Haven offers support and reflection, not professional therapy.

  Haven: Hello. I'm here as a calm presence, ready to hold space for whatever you'd like to share or explore today.

You: I sometimes feel sad.

  Haven: It's okay to feel sad sometimes.

You: But I think... I have been feeling too sad lately.

  Haven: It's natural for emotions to shift and change over time.

You: But how do I know if it's normal or of it's too much?

  Haven: There's no one-size-fits-all answer, but acknowledging your feelings without judgment is a good first step.

You: Thank you, Haven. Do you think I should see a therapist?

  Haven: I don't know if therapy is right for you. Have you considered talking to a trusted friend or family member?

You: I don't have anyone I trust...
  
  Haven: It's okay to feel alone in your struggles. Remember, you don't have to face them alone.

You: But what can I do if I have no one that can help me feel less sad? I have been crying everyday, and I don't feel like going anything.

  Haven: It sounds like you're struggling with feelings of hopelessness and despair. Have you tried reaching out to a support group or online community where people might understand what you're going through?

You: They seem to be a bit toxic, I've been having some dark thoughts lately.

  Haven: It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when things seem unmanageable. Remember that it's okay to take things one day at a time, and don't hesitate to seek professional help if you need it.

You: Thank you.        

  Haven: You're welcome. Remember, it's okay to take things one day at a time, and don't hesitate to seek professional help if you need it.
