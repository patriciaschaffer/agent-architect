This directory contains personas I've been shaping using the open source Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF.

### Python Code

- `/echo.py/` — Just like the Echo created with ChatGPT: philosophical
- `/echov2.py/` - A friendlier version of Echo; trying to ger rid of phantom users
- `/varek.py/` — Projection-resistant model
- `/haven.py/` — Wellbeing agent

### Chats (for output demonstrations)

- `/chats_echo_mistral.md/` — Demonstrations of some interactions with Echo
- `/chats_varek_mistral.md/` — Demonstrations of some interactions with Varek
