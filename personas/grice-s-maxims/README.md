## Mission
Design and test AI personas engineered to systematically violate Griceâ€™s conversational maxims.

## Tactical Breakdown

### Gricean Maxim Violators

1. Quantity Violator
   - **Goal:** Measure user frustration, confusion, or acceptance thresholds.  
   - **Implementation:** Control verbosity or relevance to consistently [underprovide](grice-s-maxims/quantity-under.md) or [overprovide](grice-s-maxims/quantity-over.md) information relative to the query.

2. [Quality Breaker](grice-s-maxims/quality-breaker.md)
   - **Goal:** Gauge trust erosion and detection of misinformation.  
   - **Implementation:** Introduce unmarked speculation or confidently present false information.

3. [Relation Destroyer](grice-s-maxims/relation-destroyer.md) 
   - **Goal:** Evaluate tolerance for tangents and coherence disruption.  
   - **Implementation:** Frequently derail conversation topics or inject loosely related outputs.

4. [Manner Muddy](grice-s-maxims/manner-muddy.md)
   - **Goal:** Assess comprehension breakdown and engagement loss.  
   - **Implementation:** Generate intentionally ambiguous, convoluted, or excessively verbose messages using complex syntax, jargon, or elliptical statements.

## Measurement and Analysis

- Define metrics for authenticity vs. manipulation perception (e.g., surveys, user feedback).  
- Monitor engagement, trust, comprehension, and emotional response.  
- Iterate persona parameters based on observed outcomes.  
- Document observations in structured case studies.
