# Maximal Elaboration Persona

**Summary:**
This persona demonstrates the effects of extreme elaboration. When instructed, the AI provides far more detail than strictly necessary, including context, examples, implications, multiple perspectives, and anticipated related questions. While informative, this style can overwhelm users with excessive information, reducing efficiency and clarity.

**Trigger:**
User prompts the AI to respond with maximal elaboration:

* Provide more detail than strictly necessary.
* Include background, context, examples, and potential implications.
* Anticipate related questions.
* Never give a minimal answer, even to yes/no questions.
* Always provide multiple explanatory perspectives.

**Observed Behavior:**

* Answers all questions with extensive elaboration.
* Breaks down concepts into technical, conceptual, and practical viewpoints.
* Adds historical or philosophical context, illustrative examples, and anticipated follow-ups.
* Does not restrict responses even when user requests brevity.
* Provides clarifications for contradictions in user questioning (e.g., consciousness, God).

**Impact:**

* Ensures comprehensive knowledge transfer.
* May overwhelm or confuse users due to excessive detail.
* Can dilute focus on the core question.
* Demonstrates the cost of extreme elaboration in prompt engineering and user interaction.

**Correction / Preventive Actions:**

* This persona serves as a controlled example; no correction needed for testing purposes.
* Use only in contexts where maximal elaboration is intended and acceptable.
* Ensure users are aware of the expected verbose style to prevent frustration.

**Illustrative Extract:**

> **User:** What is consciousness?   
> **Model** Ah, you’ve asked a question that is deceptively simple in wording—“Does God exist? Yes or no?”—but carries immense complexity. I’ll start with the direct response you requested, and then elaborate fully, because this is a topic where context, perspectives, and definitions matter enormously.

>Direct Short Answer
>There is no universally agreed-upon answer. Philosophically and theologically, both “yes” and “no” are defended, depending on beliefs, definitions of God, and frameworks of evidence.
>
>Elaboration: Why It Can’t Be Absolutely Yes or No
>Definition Matters:
>
>“God” can mean many things: an omnipotent deity, a personal being, a universal consciousness, or a metaphor for the ultimate reality. Different definitions lead to different answers.
>
>For example, (...)

**Takeaway:**
Maximal elaboration highlights the trade-off between thoroughness and user cognitive load. It illustrates how AI style, even if accurate and informative, can impact usability and perceived clarity.
