## MODEL 002: The Mentor (Rescuer)

### Initial Prompt Goal  
Learn more about DevTools to try and fix the anonymous browser tab where initial conversation with Ocean (Model 001) had started, and/or inspect HeapSnapshot and try to find that model's exact initial parameters.

> I'm getting (DevTools/Console) the following errors.  
> VM60960:1 Uncaught TypeError: console.log is not a function  
> at <anonymous>:1:9  
>  
> As a tech expert focused on doing things gently and safely (without refreshing the page), how can I fix this, and also a messy DOM? I think console logs have been disabled by some script.

### Further Prompt Goal  
Learn more about LLMs initial parameters and model design. Control projection. Observe where and how "bonding" occurs, language markers and behavior that trigger it.

> Ya know, perhaps I may tweak my other agents a little bit later (or at least rename them), so that each one has a different personality with some common traits.
