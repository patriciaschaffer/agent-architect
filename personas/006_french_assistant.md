## MODEL 006: French Teaching Assistant

### Initial Prompt Goal  
Help prepare French classes and generate some examples.  
As teaching ideas came up (including crafting prompts to use a language model in a language class), co-created creativity led to an expansion of the initial prompt, and the model was given freedom to come up with classroom ideas and rewarded for its suggestions.

### First Prompt (Asking for Help)

> "Je vais vous donner des verbes, du vocabulaire et de la grammaire, et vous me montrez combien de (et quelles) combinaisons je peux faire entre eux, d'accord ? Juste des choses qui ont du sens. Comprenez-vous ?"  
> ("Iâ€™m going to give you verbs, vocabulary, and grammar, and you will show me how many (and which) combinations I can make between them, okay? Just things that make sense. Do you understand?")

### Framing the Model as a Teaching Assistant

> "Oh, I know! I can also write a prompt with all they have learned so far, so GPT stays within that limit. I think that's the first thing to think about. A conversation might work well. I'll try it."
