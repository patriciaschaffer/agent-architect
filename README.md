# agent-architect
Agent Architect is a work-in-progress repository focused on designing and testing AI agents with distinct temperaments and dynamic behaviors. It provides frameworks for prompt engineering, temperament mapping, drift detection, and stress testing to build aligned, predictable, and nuanced AI interlocutors beyond basic language models.

Overview
This repository documents the development of frameworks, tools, and methods to architect AI agents with nuanced behavioral profiles and interaction dynamics.

Unlike foundational language models—which are probabilistic mirrors without intent or agency—this project explores how to design and refine AI agents that embody distinct temperaments and interactive roles through:

Agent-specific prompt engineering

Temperament mapping and behavioral drift detection

Multi-path priming trees and pressure test matrices

Detailed logging and analysis of agent dialogues and state changes

By formalizing agent temperament and drift, this work aims to build safer, more predictable, and aligned AI interlocutors tailored for specific purposes.

Why Agent Architect?
Moves beyond “model as passive tool” to “agent as active participant”

Addresses the complexity of maintaining consistent agent behavior over time

Enables systematic evaluation and refinement of agent personas

Bridges theoretical AI behavior with practical design and testing workflows
