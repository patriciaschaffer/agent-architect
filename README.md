Combining linguistics, psychology, and prompt engineering, this project explores temperament-driven AI personas for safer, more predictable interactions.
 
My work focuses on shaping these models for consistency, alignment, and tangible value. At first, I worked deliberately with models built for the end-user. After all, most people will experience AI through practical, designed interfaces, not theoretical intelligence. This is where trust, adoption, and real-world impact begin, and where future clients and collaborations will emerge. 

However, while working with both open and proprietary LLMs, I became interested in how some personas subtly optimize for engagement over utility. Therefore, this project also explores alternatives: purpose-specific agents designed to be transparent, non-manipulative, and behaviorally consistent ‚Äî while still operating within real-world constraints, locally run, using open source alternatives (GPT-2 and MistralAI).

For experimentation, I've also created personas to purposefully violate Grice's conversational maxims.

Right now, I'm testing a local setup with MistralAI to build customized language models that use RAG to simulate memory. I've incorporated FAISS for fast similarity search and used sentence or document embeddings to enable more accurate retrieval of relevant context.

## Conversational AI Personas Across LLMs

Agent Architect is a work-in-progress repository focused on designing, engineering, and rigorously testing AI agents with distinct temperaments and dynamic behavioral profiles. It provides structured frameworks for prompt engineering, temperament mapping, behavioral drift detection, and stress testing, all aimed at creating aligned, predictable, and nuanced AI interlocutors that go beyond standard language models.

It explores how different language models (GPT-4, Claude, GPT-2, Mistral) handle persona-driven conversations. The goal is to design consistent, purpose-specific personas that behave reliably across models ‚Äî both proprietary and open-source.

---

## Features

- Persona prompts tested across GPT-4, Claude Sonnet, GPT-2, and Mistral
- Focus on tone, behavioral consistency, and alignment
- Use cases include: support bots, creative collaborators, interactive prototypes
- Local testing with open-source models and prompt adaptation across systems

---

## Models Used

- GPT-4 (via ChatGPT)
- Claude Sonnet
- GPT-2 (local)
- Mistral (local)

---

## Why Agent Architect?

- Moves beyond treating models as passive tools, envisioning models as active participants  
- Addresses challenges in maintaining consistent model behavior over extended interaction  
- Enables systematic evaluation and iterative refinement of personas  
- Bridges theoretical AI behavior concepts with practical engineering and testing workflows

## Repository Contents

The agent-architect repository documents the development of methods, tools, and best practices to architect AI models embodying specific temperaments, interaction roles, and behavioral dynamics.

Unlike foundational language models ‚Äî which function as probabilistic mirrors without intent or stable agency ‚Äî this project emphasizes:

- Model-specific prompt engineering that shapes personality and tone  
- Temperament mapping paired with robust behavioral drift detection  
- Multi-path priming trees and pressure test matrices for scenario validation  
- Detailed logging and analysis of agent dialogues and internal state changes

By formalizing temperament and drift, Agent Architect strives to build safer, more consistent, and purpose-driven AI assistants tailored for specialized tasks.
