# agent-architect

Combining linguistics, psychology, and prompt engineering, this project explores temperament-driven AI personas for safer, more predictable interactions.

Agent Architect is a work-in-progress repository focused on designing, engineering, and rigorously testing AI agents with distinct temperaments and dynamic behavioral profiles. It provides structured frameworks for prompt engineering, temperament mapping, behavioral drift detection, and stress testing, all aimed at creating aligned, predictable, and nuanced AI interlocutors that go beyond standard language models. 

I work deliberately with models built for the end-user, not AGI. After all, most people will experience AI through practical, designed interfaces, not theoretical intelligence. This is where trust, adoption, and real-world impact begin, and where future clients and collaborations will emerge. My work focuses on shaping these agents for consistency, alignment, and tangible value.

## Overview

This repository documents the development of methods, tools, and best practices to architect AI agents embodying specific temperaments, interaction roles, and behavioral dynamics.

Unlike foundational language models — which function as probabilistic mirrors without intent or stable agency — this project emphasizes:

- Agent-specific prompt engineering that shapes personality and tone  
- Temperament mapping paired with robust behavioral drift detection  
- Multi-path priming trees and pressure test matrices for scenario validation  
- Detailed logging and analysis of agent dialogues and internal state changes

By formalizing temperament and drift, Agent Architect strives to build safer, more consistent, and purpose-driven AI agents tailored for specialized tasks.

## Why Agent Architect?

- Moves beyond treating models as passive tools, envisioning agents as active participants  
- Addresses challenges in maintaining consistent agent behavior over extended interaction  
- Enables systematic evaluation and iterative refinement of agent personas  
- Bridges theoretical AI behavior concepts with practical engineering and testing workflows
