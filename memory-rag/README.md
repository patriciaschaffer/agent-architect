I haven't had the time to post here, but my ongoing projects aim at memory simulation for local models with RAG.

I'm working on a local setup with MistralAI to build customized language models that use RAG to simulate memory. I'm experimenting with FAISS for fast similarity search and using sentence or document embeddings to enable more accurate retrieval of relevant context.
