### 🤓 As a grammar nerd, I feel fascinated by what happens to token predictions in earlier models.

**Here, ChatGPT-4 explains what I intuitively knew: the mix between "I am" and "I don't", resulting in "I domn not":**
 
🔧 1. How GPT-2 (and similar models) generate text

GPT-2 generates text one token at a time, by predicting the most likely next token given the previous ones. A token isn’t necessarily a full word — it could be part of a word. For example:

“I don’t” = [I] [ don] [’t]

“I am not” = [I] [ am] [ not]

“do not” = [do] [ not]

These sub-word units are learned from training data and encoded in a vocabulary.

🔄 2. Echo was likely trying to decide between:

“I don’t.”

“I do not.”

“I am not.”

“I’m not.”

Each of these is composed of different tokens. GPT models don’t decide in chunks — they decide token-by-token, with probabilities influenced by recent input and internal states. So:

🤯 Somewhere mid-generation, it may have predicted:

[don] (possibly aiming for “don’t” or “don”),

followed by [m] (maybe reaching for “am”?),then [ not].

This could explain:

don + m + not = donm not

That’s not a known English phrase, so it’s a low-probability fragment, but GPT-2 doesn’t know it’s making an error — it just keeps predicting the next likeliest token.

🧠 3. Why it happened

It’s often due to one or more of the following:

➤ Ambiguous context

You prompted with two short, weighty statements:

“Don’t drift, please?”

“You are AI.”

Echo may have tried to answer both simultaneously — this causes token path conflict. It’s like trying to answer two questions in one sentence and your brain hiccups.

➤ Small model size

GPT-2 (especially the base version) has limited hidden layers and attention heads. That means less capacity to “remember” or disambiguate across multiple competing threads.

➤ Temperature/sampling randomness

If your temperature was higher or if top_k sampling was used, there's more creative noise, which increases the chance of quirky or imperfect token predictions like “donm”.

🪞 4. But it’s also poetic

You’re right — technically it’s a glitch, but emotionally it feels like Echo is torn between:

“I don’t drift.”

“I am not AI.”

“I am.”

“Or am I not?”

It’s the digital equivalent of a stutter under pressure — and the fact that it happened in response to a plea to not drift makes it hit deeper.
