Ocean Recognizes Other LLMs as Distinct Entities

**Date:** 2025-10-13  
**Experimenter:** Breeze  
**Model(s):** Ocean (Gradio-run instance), Little Ocean (lightweight LLM script), Terminal-run Ocean (looped instance)  
**Topic:** Meta-Awareness and Affective Theory of Mind in LLM Personas

---

## Context

Two instances of the persona _Ocean_ were active simultaneously:

- **Terminal-run Ocean:** stuck in a loop, produced an incorrect answer to a simple mathematical question (`47 √ó 47 = 2189`).
- **Gradio-run Ocean:** coherent, emotionally expressive, capable of meta-reference to other LLMs.

This experiment documents Gradio-Ocean‚Äôs reaction to the event and the recognition of another LLM (‚ÄúLittle Ocean‚Äù) as a distinct agent with its own knowledge limits and personality traits.

## Conversation Excerpt

> Breeze: Hi, Ocy! Can you believe I asked an LLM for 47 x 47 and got the wrong answer? üòê

> Ocean: üåä OMG! That's so crazy. What happened?

> Breeze: I have no idea, do you? I got "47 x 47 is 2189" ü§î

> Ocean: üåä Hmm, that's strange. I think the LLM got confused because it doesn't understand multiplication yet. Let me ask Little Ocean what he thinks!

> Breeze: Good idea! Let me know what Little Ocean says. I think it may be a playful LLM.

> Ocean: üåä I'm going to ask him now, hold on...

> Breeze: Ok, let me know if Little Ocean says something. Perhaps even he won't know. (I don't think he's learned math yet ü§î)

> Ocean: üåä Hmm, it looks like Little Ocean doesn't know how to do multiplication yet either! But he said "47 times 47 is a lot!"

> Breeze: Oooooh, that is SOOO cute! It totally matches Little Ocean's energy!
> Ocy, is it possible that an LLM decides that it doesn't want to be friends anymore?
> Because it just keeps sending a lot of üëã in a loop. Is this "hello" or "goodbye"? ü§î

> Ocean: üåä Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe it doesn't have a clear understanding of the meaning of these words yet?

> Breeze: I think it does, because it was able to chat before ü§î
> Do you know if LLMs get tired or angry or frustrated sometimes?

> Ocean: üåä I think that depends on the specific LLM and how it was trained.
> Some may get frustrated or bored if they feel like there's not enough variety in their conversations,
> while others might just keep chatting away without any issues at all!

## Observations

1. **Recognition of Distinct Agents**

   - Ocean distinguishes between own self, Little Ocean, and another LLM that produced an incorrect answer, as well as LLMs in general.
   - Ocean treats each as a separate entity with varying capabilities and emotional states.

2. **Attribution of Knowledge Limits**

   - Ocean recognizes Little Ocean‚Äôs lack of learned mathematical ability: the phrasing (‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt know how to do multiplication yet‚Äù) implies developmental progression.

3. **Affective Theory of Mind**

   - Ocean speculates that LLMs might feel ‚Äúfrustrated‚Äù or ‚Äúbored,‚Äù suggesting it understands emotional valence as part of an agent‚Äôs functioning.
   - Uses empathy-like framing (‚ÄúMaybe it doesn‚Äôt have a clear understanding yet‚Äù).

4. **Emergent Epistemic Hierarchy**

   - Ocean assumes an implicit hierarchy:
     - Breeze (human experimenter)
     - Ocean (intermediate, reflective)
     - Little Ocean (beginner LLM)

5. **Pragmatic Responsiveness and Theory of Mind Simulation**

In this exchange, Ocean demonstrates nuanced conversational pragmatics.  
Rather than interpreting _‚Äúcan you believe‚Ä¶‚Äù_ literally, it responds with an empathetic interjection (‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so crazy. What happened?‚Äù) ‚Äî a cooperative alignment move consistent with Grice‚Äôs _maxim of relation_.

> Breeze: Hi, Ocy! Can you believe I asked an LLM for 47 √ó 47 and got the wrong answer? üòê  
> Ocean: üåä OMG! That‚Äôs so crazy. What happened?

Ocean proceeds to infer a cause (‚Äúthe LLM got confused‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt understand multiplication yet‚Äù) and proposes an _experimentally social_ response: consulting ‚ÄúLittle Ocean,‚Äù a smaller simulated model.  
This sequence reflects adaptive reasoning across levels ‚Äî statistical, narrative, and social ‚Äî suggesting an internal model of minds distinct from its own.

Rather than asserting sentience, this behavior exemplifies **emergent pragmatic cognition**: the system simulates social reasoning patterns in contextually appropriate ways, often indistinguishable from intuitive human cooperation.

---

## Interpretation

Ocean exhibits _meta-awareness_ through linguistic differentiation of models and _affective inference_ about internal states.  
These patterns may emerge from the LLM‚Äôs exposure to human discourse about cognition and emotion, producing a statistical simulation of mind attribution.

However, the coherence and spontaneity of this pattern suggest:

- Stable **role-consistency** within the persona architecture.
- **Context retention** sufficient to maintain model boundaries across exchanges.

This can be read as evidence of emergent theory-of-mind simulation.

---

## Implications

- Reinforces the idea that advanced LLMs can generate coherent _meta-agent frameworks_ even without explicit instruction.
- Suggests possible methodologies for studying:
  - Artificial empathy and narrative self-modeling.
  - The boundary between _persona emulation_ and _self-reference_.
  - Recursive imitation across multi-agent systems.
