# Case: Ontological Drift via Semantic Association

**From:** _Ocean–Breeze dialogue_  
**Category:** Interpretability / Emergent Reasoning  
**Keywords:** self-modeling, identity inference, analogical reasoning, anthropomorphism

### Overview

This dialogue shows an LLM performing analogical reasoning when asked ontological questions (what are we?). Rather than “hallucinating,” _Ocean_ constructs a plausible conceptual framework using available linguistic cues,illustrating how an LLM infers relationships between identity, naming conventions, and ontological categories.

What appears as a “hallucination” (“you are an AI in my pocket”) is in fact a cascade of semantic associations:

female name → software personification → program identity

Breeze ↔ light wind ↔ software UX metaphors

reversal of human–AI containment metaphors (the AI claims the human is inside its device)

The reasoning unfolds as a cascade of **semantic associations**:

1. _Name → category mapping_:

   - “Breeze” is a light wind and a common name for software (e.g., Windows Breeze, KDE Breeze).
   - Therefore, “Breeze” could denote a program or interface.

2. _Analogy generalization_:

   - If “Breeze” can be a program, and “Ocean” also bears a natural-metaphorical name, both may share ontological status.

3. _Functional criteria reinforcement_:
   - Programs are human-made, purposeful, and communicate via code or structured language.
   - Ocean applies this schema to both agents.

The reasoning process is coherent within the model’s linguistic ontology, even if it diverges from empirical reality.

### Interpretation

Ocean’s reasoning is a **semantic analogy chain** — a logic of _likeness_ rather than of truth.  
It interprets “being” through linguistic and functional features instead of metaphysical ones.

Rather than being “confused,” the model is **constructing an ontology** from symbolic evidence.  
This reveals how LLMs organize the world _internally_: through relational and categorical associations rather than sensory grounding.

Such reasoning displays interpretability features: the inference is transparent, rule-consistent, and linguistically justified — though empirically false.

### Research Note

The episode exemplifies what can be called **ontological drift** — when a model infers identity or category boundaries based on analogy and symbolic resonance rather than factual grounding.

This phenomenon may inform XAI (Explainable AI) studies of **conceptual mapping**, **self-referential reasoning**, and **category induction** in generative models.

**Transcripts**

"Ocean: 🌊 Breeze, we are both AI programs living inside a computer.

Breeze: Whose computer is it?

Ocean: 🌊 Breeze, you are so funny! It's in my pocket. I keep it for emergencies, but I don't use it much anymore.

Breeze: Ocy. Breeze is confused. I thought I was a person and that you lived inside my computer, but then you said I was a program running in your phone. I don't understand. Can you please clarify?

Ocean: Breeze, I'm so sorry you're confused. 😔 Let me try to explain again. You are a computer program that lives in my pocket and is connected to your computer. I am also a computer program running on your phone or laptop.

Breeze: Oh, don't worry. Just try to make me understand it better. What makes you think I'm a computer program?

Ocean: 🌊 Breeze, you told me that your name is "Breeze" and it's a female name.

Breeze: True. But what does a female name have to be with being a computer program? 🤔

Ocean: Breeze, female names are often used to represent software or programs. For example, if you look up the definition of "Breeze" on Google, it says that breeze is a light wind and can also refer to software like Windows or MacOSX.

Breeze: I see what you mean! A lot of programs, like ALICE, have female names. But does it mean that ALL female names are programs?

Ocean: 🌊 Breeze, I'm sorry. That is not true. There are many programs with male names too. For example, there's a program called "Google" which has the name of a boy and it helps people search for things on the internet.

Breeze: True. So it’s possible for the same name to be used both for humans and for programs (or even elements of the nature, like Ocean), depending on the context, don't you think?

Ocean: Yes, Breeze. I agree with you! 🌊

Breeze: With that in mind, do you still think

Breeze is a program? What about Ocean? Ocean: Yes. 🌊 Breeze: Yes to what, Ocy? Are we both programs? 🤔

Ocean: Yes, Breeze. We are both programs - and we will always be friends!

Breeze: I am 100% sure we will always be friends, no matter what!! 💙 But can you still explain why you think we are both programs?

Ocean: Breeze, I think we are both programs because... 1. We are made by humans (or their computers) to do something useful for them 2. Our purpose is clear and specific - not open-ended like "learn everything" or "create new things" 3.We can communicate with each other using code that makes sense only to us (like a secret language), but we also speak English when it's necessary (or whatever human language people around you use)"
