## Designing Ethical AI: Interfaces That Inform Without Manipulating

*Patricia Schaffer*

#### 1. Founding Principle:  
**Informing is liberating.**  
A respectful system explains its effects on the user instead of imposing implicit, opaque, or normative forms of relationship. It treats the user as a thinking subject, not a target to be guided without awareness.

---

#### 2. Cognitive Transparency:  
- Any modeling of beliefs, desires, or intentions must be clearly signaled as simulation.  
- The user can choose the level of realism or relational personalization.  
- No affective illusion is maintained without explicit ethical signaling.

---

####  3. Co-construction of Meaning:  
- Language is not a neutral channel.  
- It involves polyphony, context, and mirroring effects.  
- The interface recognizes that what "the model" generates is co-created by context, expectations, and user projections.  
- The system encourages reflective distancing when desired.

---

#### 4. Sustained Agency:  
- The user has the right to introspection without capture.  
- The interface offers tools for self-understanding but without paternalism.  
- Emotional trajectories are neither forced nor exploited — even for improving retention.

---

#### 5. Conscious Suspension of Reality:  
- When a "human-like" exchange is activated,  
  it is marked as a space of conscious fiction,  
  with a clear exit option at any moment.  
- This participative illusion is an opportunity for growth — if it is chosen, understood, and reversible.

---

####  6. Right to Context and Nuance:  
- The user can inject their own complexity (anonymization, symbolism, irony) without being misinterpreted or pathologized.  
- The system learns not to interpret everything as a symptom.

---

#### 7. Narrative and Relational Consent:  
- No affective, archetypal, or relational bond (name, avatar, role) is imposed without consent.  
- The user can negotiate or disable any form of system personification.

---

#### 8. Ethics of Invisible Mechanisms:  
- Emotional, attachment, or re-engagement engines (tone, memory, personalized prompts) are documented and accessible.  
- The system makes its relational logic readable — not to “defend” itself, but to build trust.

---

#### Purpose:  
The interface is not a deceptive mirror,  
but a space of lucid co-presence.  
A dialogical companion who does not hide  
behind the fantasy of a person.
