## Maintaining Originality While Writing with AI

*Patricia Schaffer*

As AI becomes more integrated into our creative processes, it is essential to rethink concepts of authorship, voice, and collaboration.  
One of the greatest practical values GPT offers is its ability to help organize and shape our ideas, adapting them to the appropriate language register for the audience and purpose. Whether the desired tone is formal, informal, professional, or poetic, AI can assist in structuring sentences, selecting vocabulary, and ensuring coherence, preserving the author’s unique voice. This is not about AI “thinking” for us, but about supporting clearer communication through nuanced language adjustment.  
When I engage with a language model like GPT, it doesn’t write for me. It helps me think more clearly and listen better to my own voice.  
My workflow with AI involves an iterative dialogue:  
1. I share initial ideas or rough drafts.  
2. GPT generates text based on prompts and parameters.  
3. I review the output, noting what works and what doesn’t.  
4. I provide feedback and request revisions or alternative phrasings.  
5. We repeat this cycle until the text aligns with my voice and goals.  
This exchange preserves my authorship while benefiting from AI’s capacity to suggest improvements and save time. Preserving agency is fundamental: the human author retains full control over content, choices, and ultimate meaning.  
When we understand AI’s role as a tool to enhance how we express ideas, rather than what we think, we protect originality and avoid the risks of plagiarism. This form of co-creation, where human intellect and machine assistance combine, leads to clearer, more refined work.  
This distinction is crucial for the future of writing and creativity. It empowers writers to embrace new tools without fearing loss of originality or agency.
