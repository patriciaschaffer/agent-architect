# Archetypes Overview

## Introduction

This document defines the core archetypes used in the model persona design framework.  
Archetypes are foundational personality and behavioral patterns that guide how each AI model interacts, responds, and evolves.  
They matter because well-crafted archetypes ensure consistency, clarity, and alignment with project goals, preventing unwanted drift or confusion in agent behavior.  

Here you will find a table linking each model archetype to its detailed persona file, alongside concise descriptions.  
Below the table, expanded summaries offer deeper insight into each archetypeâ€™s key traits, objectives, and ideal use cases.

- **Drift monitoring:** Archetypes help detect and correct persona drift by providing clear baselines for behavior and style.  
- **Persona updates:** When refining models, refer to the archetype definitions to ensure changes align with core goals and do not undermine consistency.  
- **Linkage:** All persona markdown files are linked above to facilitate easy cross-reference and updates.
